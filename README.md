# PhotoBook

Application created for Mobile Application Development Fall 2014.
Worked with two students to create a simple photo album application for Android.


Users can take photos to save in their own personal photo albums. 
The location, weather, time, as well as a user inputted caption are all stored with the image.
When the user looks thru the album, this information can be viewed for each individual photo. 

User must create an account and log in to use the application.
